I've been updating my [GitHub account][gh] to have some more recent projects with 
all code available. Though I can't release everything I'd like to (some of it 
will be transitioned off to Class Councils and others next year), I'm putting 
up every project I can find and putting together small READMEs if its behavior 
isn't immediately apparent.

With any of my projects, feel free to use the code in any way you'd like. 
A few days ago, I had a friend ask if he could use the code for one of his own 
projects, despite not actually needing the code of the application itself, more
just the skeleton of the website (because I like to make things pretty with 
[Twitter Bootstrap][tb]). If that's what you're looking for, go for it.

As I put more projects up, I'll update my site with the details of what
I've released.

I also just opened up my [Twitter][twitter] to the public (before I had
a private account). I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, but I'd like
to think it won't destroy my career potential...So find me on Twitter if you 
need anything!
