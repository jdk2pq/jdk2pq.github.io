	<h1>Music</h1>
	<p>I've always been interested in music. I started playing violin in 5th grade, took up guitar a year later, and came across this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeP1Klmk0ng">YouTube video</a> the summer leading to my Senior Year of high school, which led to my picking up the ukulele. I've performed at bars, in talent shows, and open mic nights, and while I'm not that great, I truly love playing and listening to music every day.</p>

	<p>Here's what I've been listening to:</p>

	<p>I'd also like to think I listen to some lesser-known artists, so this widget from <a href="http://obscurometer.com/">Obscurometer.com</a> will tell me if I'm right (I'm probably not):</p>

	<p>Finally, I've been growing a small vinyl collection. Here's a link to my current inventory:</p>
