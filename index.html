	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I’m a software developer who enjoys web development, data visualization, and applications that help others.</p>

	<p>Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.ccri.com/">Commonwealth Computer Research, Inc.</a> in Charlottesville, VA, where I work on <a href="http://www.ccri.com/case-studies/arpeggio/">Arpeggio</a>, a data visualization and analytics suite. Previously, I worked on an open-source, distributed, spatio-temporal database, <a href="http://geomesa.org">GeoMesa</a>.</p>

	<p>Personal projects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I made <a href="http://diduvawin.com/">DidUVAWin.com</a>. Go Hoos.</li>
		<li>I created <a href="http://rushthetachiuva.com/">a system</a> to organize Fraternity Rush at UVA for my fraternity, Theta Chi.</li>
		<li>I helped design <a href="http://kevin.4mcveys.com/CS1501/finals/team_5/index.html">visualizations</a> of Mumford and Sons lyrics.</li>
		<li>I designed <a href="http://beforeyougraduate.uva2014.com/">an application</a> to manage the completion of UVA’s “114 Things To Do Before We Graduate” list.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2014. I was the first Senior Resident of <a href="http://news.virginia.edu/content/incoming-first-year-students-get-three-new-residence-halls">Tuttle-Dunnington Residence Hall</a>, served as a Class of 2014 Trustee, and worked as <a href="http://social.virginia.edu/how-the-rotunda-light-show-came-together-for-lighting-of-the-lawn">the Marketing Committee chair</a> for the 2013 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-miMTN_jek8">Lighting of the Lawn.</a></p>

	<p>In my free time, I <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jakeapher">listen to</a> and play a lot of music. I once <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3603517/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">starred in a dramatic reenactment true crime show</a> on Discovery Channel, my favorite movies are the <a href="http://www.bttf.com/">Back to the Future trilogy</a>, and I homebrew my own beer. Plus, I’m always up for <a href="https://untappd.com/user/jkenneally">trying a new craft brew</a>.
