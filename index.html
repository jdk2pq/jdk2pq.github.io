	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys Web development, data science and visualization, and applications that help others.</p>

	<p>Currently, I work as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.ccri.com/">Commonwealth Computer Research, Inc.</a> in Charlottesville, VA, where I work on an open-source, distributed, spatio-temporal database, <a href="http://geomesa.org">GeoMesa</a>. Previously, I interned at <a href="https://www.genworth.com/">Genworth Financial</a> in Richmond, VA, where I implemented a database-driven CodeIgniter (PHP) webapp to inventory 300+ server nodes, talk to <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, and control the provisioning and orchestration of each node through a simple UI. I also served as a Resident Advisor and Senior Resident at the University of Virginia for three years while in school.</p>

	<p>Personal projects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I made <a href="http://diduvawin.com/">DidUVaWin.com</a>. Go Hoos.</li>
		<li>I created <a href="http://rushthetachiuva.com/">a system</a> to organize Fraternity Rush at UVa for my fraternity, Theta Chi.</li>
		<li>I helped design <a href="http://kevin.4mcveys.com/CS1501/finals/team_5/index.html">visualizations</a> of Mumford and Sons lyrics.</li>
		<li>I designed <a href="http://beforeyougraduate.uva2014.com/">an application</a> to manage the completion of UVa’s “114 Things To Do Before We Graduate” list.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I made my mark at UVa in being the first Senior Resident for <a href="http://news.virginia.edu/content/incoming-first-year-students-get-three-new-residence-halls">Tuttle-Dunnington Residence Hall</a>, serving as a Class of 2014 Trustee, and working as <a href="http://social.virginia.edu/how-the-rotunda-light-show-came-together-for-lighting-of-the-lawn">the Marketing Committee chair</a> for the 2013 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-miMTN_jek8">Lighting of the Lawn.</a></p>

	<p>In my free time, I <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jakeapher">listen to</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2EukZUovAk">play</a> a lot of music. I love watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejc5zic4q2A">comedy</a>, my favorite movies are the <a href="http://www.bttf.com/">Back to the Future trilogy</a>, and I have a giant t-shirt collection (144 and counting). I’m also always up for <a href="https://untappd.com/user/jkenneally">trying new craft beer</a>.
