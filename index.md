## About me

I‚Äôm a software engineer interested in front end development, all things JS, and improving performance.

Currently, I'm a Principal Front End Engineer at [Fundrise](https://www.fundrise.com). 

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Dorsata](https://www.dorsata.com/) working on their [prenatal electronic health record](https://dorsata.com/prenatal/).

Before that, I was a UI/UX Software engineer at [CCRi](http://www.ccri.com/) on Stealth, a web-based map client for performing complex spatial analytics and visualizing geospatial data, Arpeggio, a marketing and sales trend analytics application, and [GeoMesa](http://geomesa.org), an open-source, distributed, geospatial database.
